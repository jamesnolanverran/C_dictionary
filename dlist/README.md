# Dynamic HashMap / Dictionary in C

**This is an experiment - and a work in progress**

- Goal: build a simple python-like dictionary / hash table in C (C11)
- This is a personal learning project. I'm learning C and trying out different ideas and idioms I've learned from other programmers. Feedback is welcome. 
- Inspired by Per Vognsen's stretchy buffer implementation in his [Bitwise][playlist] series, which is included here (arr).
- Currently uses MurmerHash2 by Austin Appleby
